# tuning-LLM
Repo with simple scripts for fine-tuning LLMs

# Approaches
For now, we rely on SFTTrainer from the trl library.
I hope I will be able to update the repo in the future to accomodate more examples.

# Structure of the repo
- example_notebooks -> contains example notebooks for training
- scripts -> contrains all the usefull scripts you might need for finetuning the LLMs
